PostgreSQL Database Management System
=====================================

This directory contains the source code distribution of the PostgreSQL
database management system.

PostgreSQL is an advanced object-relational database management system
that supports an extended subset of the SQL standard, including
transactions, foreign keys, subqueries, triggers, user-defined types
and functions.  This distribution also contains C language bindings.

Copyright and license information can be found in the file COPYRIGHT.

General documentation about this version of PostgreSQL can be found at
<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/>.  In particular, information
about building PostgreSQL from the source code can be found at
<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/installation.html>.

The latest version of this software, and related software, may be

look at our web site located at <https://www.postgresql.org/>.

To run the database, create a postgres user on your VM/Instance:
```
adduser postgres
mkdir -p /usr/local/pgsql/data
chown postgres /usr/local/pgsql/data
su - postgres
/usr/local/pgsql/bin/initdb -D /usr/local/pgsql/data
/usr/local/pgsql/bin/pg_ctl -D /usr/local/pgsql/data -l logfile start
```

As the postgres user, add to your PATH variable for psql usage:
```
PATH=/usr/local/pgsql/bin:$PATH
export PATH
```
