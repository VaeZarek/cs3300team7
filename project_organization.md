## **1. `core`:**

- **Foundation and User Management:** This app holds the core user model of your application, custom user (`core.User`).
- **Base Models and Utilities:** It contains an abstract base models (like your `BaseModel` with `created_at` and `updated_at`), utility functions, or project-wide settings and configurations that don't belong to a specific feature.
- **User Types:** Your `core.User` model includes the `user_type` field (applicant/recruiter), so this app facilitates distinguishing user roles within the platform.

## **2. `applicant`:**

- **Applicant Profiles:** This app manages the profiles of individuals seeking jobs. It  includes models (`ApplicantProfile`, `Experience`, `Education`) and forms for applicants to create and update their personal and professional information (headline, summary, skills, work history, education details, resume).
- **Applicant-Specific Views:** It contains views and templates tailored to the applicant's experience, such as their dashboard, profile creation/update/view pages, and potentially views for browsing jobs and managing applications.

## **3. `recruiter`:**

- **Recruiter Profiles:** Similar to the `applicant` app, this manages the profiles of users who are hiring. It includes models and forms for recruiters to provide information about their company or their role in the hiring process.
- **Job Management:** This app is likely responsible for allowing recruiters to create, view, edit, and delete job listings (interacting with the `job` app's models).
- **Application Management (from the Recruiter Side):** It contains views and templates for recruiters to view and manage applications they've received for their job postings, including updating the application status.

## **4. `job`:**

- **Job Listings:** This app is the central repository for job postings. It contains models (`Job`) that define the attributes of a job (title, description, requirements, location, salary, etc.).
- **Job-Related Views:** It includes views and templates for displaying lists of jobs, viewing individual job details (both for applicants to browse and potentially for recruiters to manage), and potentially search and filtering functionality for job seekers.

## **5. `application`:**

- **Job Applications:** This app manages the applications submitted by applicants for specific job listings. It contains the `Application` model, which likely has foreign key relationships to `ApplicantProfile` and `Job`, and includes details about the application (applied date, status, resume, cover letter).
- **Application-Related Views:** It includes views for applicants to submit applications and for both applicants and recruiters to view application information (though the presentation and functionality will differ).

## **6. `messaging`:** (Bonus?)

- **Communication:** This app is likely responsible for enabling communication between applicants and recruiters. It would include models for messages, conversations, and views and templates for sending and receiving messages.

**How These Apps Interact:**

These apps are interconnected through foreign key relationships in their models and through the flow of data in your views and templates. For example:

- An `Application` in the `application` app links an `ApplicantProfile` from the `applicant` app to a `Job` from the `job` app.
- Recruiters in the `recruiter` app create `Job` listings in the `job` app.
- Applicants in the `applicant` app apply for `Job` listings managed by the `job` app, creating records in the `application` app.
- The `messaging` app might allow users (both applicants and recruiters) to communicate, potentially linking to their respective profiles.

**Benefits of This Modular Structure:**

- **Organization:** Keeps related features and logic grouped together.
- **Reusability:** Apps can potentially be reused in other projects.
- **Maintainability:** Makes it easier to find and modify code related to a specific feature.
- **Scalability:** Allows different teams or developers to work on different parts of the application with less risk of conflicts.
